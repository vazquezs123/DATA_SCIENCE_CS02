# Introduction

DDSAnalytics, an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 1000 companies, is launching a product designed to predict employee turnover. They asked us for help in identifying the key factors leading to attrition. They provided us with an existing dataset of employee data, and we performed an exploratory data analysis to determine what factors are associated with attrition.

# What factors are statistically significant for attrition?

To test this, we ran two-sample t-tests for each factor against attrition. We created dummy variables for each categorical variable so we could test each value separately. Note that we did not include an adjustment for multiple comparisons.

```{r T-test}
# Read in the data and adjust classes
library("openxlsx")
workers <- read.xlsx("CaseStudy2-data.xlsx")
workers$Attrition <- as.factor(workers$Attrition)
workers$BusinessTravel <- as.factor(workers$BusinessTravel)
workers$Department <- as.factor(workers$Department)
workers$EducationField <- as.factor(workers$EducationField)
workers$Gender <- as.factor(workers$Gender)
workers$JobRole <- as.factor(workers$JobRole)
workers$Over18 <- as.factor(workers$Over18)
workers$OverTime <- as.factor(workers$OverTime)
workers$JobRole <- as.factor(workers$JobRole)
workers$JobRole <- as.factor(workers$JobRole)
workers$MaritalStatus <- as.factor(workers$MaritalStatus)
# Remove "Over18", "StandardHours", "EmployeeID", and "EmployeeCount" as they are not useful
workers <- workers[,c(-9,-10,-22,-27)]
# Create dummy variables
businesstravel <- model.matrix(~0+BusinessTravel, data = workers)
department <- model.matrix(~0+Department, data = workers)
educationfield <- model.matrix(~0+EducationField, data = workers)
gender <- model.matrix(~0+Gender, data = workers)
jobrole <- model.matrix(~0+JobRole, data = workers)
maritalstatus <- model.matrix(~0+MaritalStatus, data = workers)
overtime <- model.matrix(~0+OverTime, data = workers)
workers <- data.frame(workers, businesstravel, department, educationfield, gender, jobrole, maritalstatus, overtime)
# Run t-test for each variable on attrition
for (i in c(1, 4, 6:7, 9, 11:13, 15, 17:19, 21:59)) {
  print(names(workers)[i])
  print(t.test(workers[,i] ~ Attrition, data = workers))
}
```

# What are the attrition rates for each factor?

To examine how much influence each factor has over attrition, we created tables for various factors versus attrition and calculated the attrition rate for each variable. We found that the overall attrition rate for this dataset was 16.1%. Any large deviations from that number should give us an idea of where to concentrate our efforts.

```{r Attrition Tables, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(reshape2)
paste("Overall attrition rate: ", round(table(workers$Attrition)[2]/1470, digits = 3)*100, "%", sep = "")
for (i in c(3, 5, 8:10, 12:16, 20, 22, 24, 26:27)) {
  attrTable <- as.data.frame(table(workers[,i], workers$Attrition))
  attrTable <- dcast(attrTable, Var1 ~ Var2, value.var = "Freq")
  names(attrTable)[1] <- names(workers)[i]
  attrTable$AttrRate <- attrTable$Yes/(attrTable$Yes+attrTable$No)
  print(kable(attrTable))
}
```

# Creating a predictive model

We decided to use machine learning to find the three most important factors leading to attrition. We trained a support-vector machine (SVM) model to determine what factors were most associated with attrition. We determined that the top three factors were overtime, job role, and years at company. The model predicted attrition on the test data with 83.7% accuracy.

```{r initialModel}
library(mlr)
library(kernlab)

# Remove dummy variables since we no longer need them
#workers <- workers[,1:31]

#seperate the set into training and test data
set.seed(1)
train.sample <- sample(1470, 0.8*1470)
workers.train<-workers[train.sample,-c(32:59)]
workers.test<-workers[-train.sample,-c(32:59)]

#make the tasks to train and test
class.train <- makeClassifTask(data = workers.train, target = "Attrition", positive = "Yes")
class.test <- makeClassifTask(data = workers.test, target = "Attrition", positive = "Yes")

#normalize the features
class.train <- normalizeFeatures(class.train, method="standardize")
class.test <- normalizeFeatures(class.test, method="standardize")

#make the learner
class.learn <- makeLearner("classif.ksvm", predict.type = "prob")

#Tune the Hyperparameters
ps = makeParamSet(
  makeDiscreteParam("C", values = 2^(-4:4)),
  makeDiscreteParam("sigma", values = 2^(-4:4))
)
ctrl = makeTuneControlRandom(maxit = 20)
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3L)
res = tuneParams("classif.ksvm", task = class.train, resampling = rdesc, par.set = ps, control = ctrl)
class.learn <- setHyperPars(class.learn, par.vals = res$x)

#train the model
class.learn <- train(learner = class.learn, task = class.train)

#How did the model do?
predicted <- predict(class.learn, class.test)
performance(predicted, acc)

#plot it
learningCurve <- generateLearningCurveData("classif.ksvm", class.train, percs = seq(0.05, 1, by = 0.05), measures = list(tp, fn, acc, mmce))
plotLearningCurve(learningCurve)

#What features matter?
filterValues <- generateFilterValuesData(class.train, method = c("information.gain", "chi.squared"))
plotFilterValues(filterValues, n.show = 16)

#What does this tell us?
head(predicted$data)
```

# Controlling for discrimination

To ensure we were not unintentionally discriminating on the basis of age, gender, or marital status, we removed these factors and trained another SVM model. The top three factors in this model were job role, overtime, and monthly income. The new model predicted attrition on the test set with an 89.8% accuracy.

```{r legalModel}
#seperate the set into training and test data
train.sample <- sample(1470, 0.8*1470)
workers.train <- workers[train.sample,-c(1, 10, 16, 32:59)]
workers.test <- workers[-train.sample,-c(1, 10, 16, 32:59)]

#make the tasks to train and test
legal.train <- makeClassifTask(data = workers.train, target = "Attrition", positive = "Yes")
legal.test <- makeClassifTask(data = workers.test, target = "Attrition", positive = "Yes")

# What factors lead to high attrition for sales representatives?

We were interested in figuring out what factors led to sales representatives having a particularly high attrition rate. Using a forward selection logistic regression model, we found that the top four factors associated with attrition for sales representatives were business travel, overtime, years in current role, and job satisfaction.

```{r SalesRep}
# Subset the data
salesRep <- workers[workers$JobRole == "Sales Representative",]
# Forward selection logistic regression to find most important factors
lm.null <- glm(Attrition ~ 1, data = salesRep, family = binomial)
add1(lm.null, ~Age + BusinessTravel + DailyRate + DistanceFromHome + Education + EnvironmentSatisfaction + Gender + HourlyRate + JobInvolvement + JobLevel + JobSatisfaction + MaritalStatus + MonthlyIncome + MonthlyRate + NumCompaniesWorked + OverTime + PercentSalaryHike + PerformanceRating + RelationshipSatisfaction + StockOptionLevel + TotalWorkingYears + TrainingTimesLastYear + WorkLifeBalance + YearsAtCompany + YearsInCurrentRole + YearsSinceLastPromotion + YearsWithCurrManager, test = "LRT")
add1(update(lm.null,~ . + BusinessTravel), ~Age + BusinessTravel + DailyRate + DistanceFromHome + Education + EnvironmentSatisfaction + Gender + HourlyRate + JobInvolvement + JobLevel + JobSatisfaction + MaritalStatus + MonthlyIncome + MonthlyRate + NumCompaniesWorked + OverTime + PercentSalaryHike + PerformanceRating + RelationshipSatisfaction + StockOptionLevel + TotalWorkingYears + TrainingTimesLastYear + WorkLifeBalance + YearsAtCompany + YearsInCurrentRole + YearsSinceLastPromotion + YearsWithCurrManager, test = "LRT")
add1(update(lm.null,~ . + BusinessTravel + OverTime), ~Age + BusinessTravel + DailyRate + DistanceFromHome + Education + EnvironmentSatisfaction + Gender + HourlyRate + JobInvolvement + JobLevel + JobSatisfaction + MaritalStatus + MonthlyIncome + MonthlyRate + NumCompaniesWorked + OverTime + PercentSalaryHike + PerformanceRating + RelationshipSatisfaction + StockOptionLevel + TotalWorkingYears + TrainingTimesLastYear + WorkLifeBalance + YearsAtCompany + YearsInCurrentRole + YearsSinceLastPromotion + YearsWithCurrManager, test = "LRT")

# What factors lead to high attrition for laboratory technicians?

Like the sales representatives, we wanted to identify the top factors leading to attrition for laboratory technicians. Again, we ran a forward selection logistic regression model. We found that the top four factors associated with attrition for laboratory technicians were overtime, years at company, stock option level, and environment satisfaction.

```{r LabTech}
# Subset the data
labTech <- workers[workers$JobRole == "Laboratory Technician",]
# Forward selection logistic regression to find most important factors
lm.null <- glm(Attrition ~ 1, data = labTech, family = binomial)
add1(lm.null, ~Age + BusinessTravel + DailyRate + DistanceFromHome + Education + EnvironmentSatisfaction + Gender + HourlyRate + JobInvolvement + JobLevel + JobSatisfaction + MaritalStatus + MonthlyIncome + MonthlyRate + NumCompaniesWorked + OverTime + PercentSalaryHike + PerformanceRating + RelationshipSatisfaction + StockOptionLevel + TotalWorkingYears + TrainingTimesLastYear + WorkLifeBalance + YearsAtCompany + YearsInCurrentRole + YearsSinceLastPromotion + YearsWithCurrManager, test = "LRT")

# Conclusion

Overtime and job role are highly associated with employee attrition. Other factors include monthly income, job and enviroment satisfaction, stock option level, marital status, and years at company and in the current role. We suggest the company hire more people to reduce the workload on everyone and reduce the need for overtime. The company should also work on engaging its employees more and making them more comfortable to raise job and environment satisfaction, and keep their employees invested by offering more stock options.
