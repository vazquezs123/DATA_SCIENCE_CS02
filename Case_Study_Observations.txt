- daily rate probably better metric than hourly rate, reason being that the 
daily rate gives us more of an idea of the hours worked in a day and we can
infer an average of hours worked per day
	- We know from standardHours variable 80 hrs per 2 work weeks.
		- which means 40hr/weeks
		
- graph highlighting
- variables to dismiss:
	- employee count because its always equal to 1
	- employee number just unique id
	- over18 because everyone is over 18
	- StandardHours everyone work 80 hours
